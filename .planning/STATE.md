## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Lottie player library: pending — choose lightweight player (Phase 2)
- Slixol Model mobile: scroll-based single-pod view confirmed by client
- Services mobile: scroll trigger matching HowWeWork pattern confirmed by client
- [Phase 01-content-ui-polish]: Logo alt tags left unchanged — image asset descriptions, not brand text nodes
- [Phase 01-content-ui-polish]: SlixolModel function identifier excluded from brand casing rules — code identifiers are out of scope
- [Phase 01-content-ui-polish]: Grid opacity halved (0.08→0.04) — logos visually pop without extra stacking context
- [Phase 01-content-ui-polish]: Footer overscroll debounce uses local closure var (400ms gate) not useRef — only needed in effect scope

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Lottie ZIP files must be extracted and placed before Phase 2 executes (4 files, 1080x1080, 30fps, ~6-8KB each)
