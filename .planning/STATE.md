## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Lottie player library: pending — choose lightweight player (Phase 2)
- Slixol Model mobile: scroll-based single-pod view confirmed by client
- Services mobile: scroll trigger matching HowWeWork pattern confirmed by client
- [Phase 01-content-ui-polish]: Logo alt tags left unchanged — image asset descriptions, not brand text nodes
- [Phase 01-content-ui-polish]: SlixolModel function identifier excluded from brand casing rules — code identifiers are out of scope
- [Phase 01-content-ui-polish]: Grid opacity halved (0.08→0.04) — logos visually pop without extra stacking context
- [Phase 01-content-ui-polish]: Footer overscroll debounce uses local closure var (400ms gate) not useRef — only needed in effect scope
- [Phase 02-lottie-integration]: lottie-react chosen as Lottie player; fetch() pattern ensures JSON stays out of JS bundle (CASE-02); 800px preload margin balances performance and UX
- [Phase 03-mobile-ux]: Mobile marquee speed via CSS media query (no JS overhead)
- [Phase 03-mobile-ux]: ServiceCard scroll activation self-contained (no prop drilling)
- [Phase 03-mobile-ux]: effectiveActive = isHovered || scrollActive for unified visual state
- [Phase 03-mobile-ux]: SlixolModel mobile: all 5 pods always visible, activePod driven by scroll proximity to viewport center (50%)
- [Phase 03-mobile-ux]: AnimatePresence removed from SlixolModel after accordion removal — no longer needed

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Lottie ZIP files must be extracted and placed before Phase 2 executes (4 files, 1080x1080, 30fps, ~6-8KB each)
