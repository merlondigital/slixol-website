# Requirements: Slixol Website — Client Feedback Iteration

**Defined:** 2026-03-30
**Core Value:** Premium, intentional, fast — every interaction reinforces Slixol's positioning as a professional digital growth partner.

## v1 Requirements

Requirements for this iteration. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Content Fixes

- [x] **CONT-01**: All "Slixol" text occurrences are lowercase "slixol" (except alt tags for logo images)
- [x] **CONT-02**: All em-dashes (—) in user-facing content are replaced with en-dashes (–)

### Hero Section

- [ ] **HERO-01**: Hero CTA button has no 3D perspective/transform effect
- [ ] **HERO-02**: Hero CTA button shows hover animation (outline transition, subtle scale/movement)

### Case Studies

- [x] **CASE-01**: Case study cards display Lottie animations instead of ImagePlaceholder components
- [x] **CASE-02**: Lottie files are lazy-loaded (not loaded until section approaches viewport)

### Partners Grid

- [x] **PART-01**: Grid pattern appears behind partner logos, not in front
- [x] **PART-02**: Grid has closed borders on all sides (top and bottom)

### Footer

- [x] **FOOT-01**: Overscroll-to-consultation requires exactly 3 consecutive overscroll attempts before triggering

### Mobile UX

- [x] **MOB-01**: Marquee/news bar animation completes faster (all 3 words visible sooner)
- [x] **MOB-02**: Slixol Model shows scroll-based pod showcase — one pod visible at a time with compact diagram
- [x] **MOB-03**: Service cards activate on scroll (blue dot pattern triggers when card reaches viewport center, matching HowWeWork pattern)

## v2 Requirements

### Consultation

- **CONS-01**: Calendly embed redesign after client live review (scheduled for Wednesday)

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Backend/API/CMS | Stays static — no request from client |
| Analytics integration | Not requested this round |
| Multilingual support | Not requested |
| New sections/pages | This is a polish iteration, not feature addition |
| Logo image modifications | Brand assets stay as-is, only text casing changes |

## Traceability
